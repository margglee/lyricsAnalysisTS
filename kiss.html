    <h1>Debunked: Taylor Swift uses "kissing in the rain" too often</h1>
    <p>The phrase "kissing in the rain" is only used three times in 'The Way I Loved You' in her 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift.</p>
    <p> Next, we record the number of songs with any variation of kiss (kissing, kissin', kisses) and rain (raining, rainin', rains).</p>

      google.load("visualization", "1", {packages:["corechart"]});
      google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
      function drawChart() {
        var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable( kiss );

        var options = {
          title: "Count of Songs Containing 'kiss' and 'rain'"
        };

        var chart = new google.visualization.LineChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
        chart.draw(data, options);
      }

    <p> In her sophomore album, the kiss appeared in approximately half of her songs and both words appeared in her songs three times.
       In her fifth and sixth album, the two words are not in the same songs. Using this graph, is it significant proof to call her a
        songwriter that uses cliche imagery with 'kiss' and 'rain'?</p>
