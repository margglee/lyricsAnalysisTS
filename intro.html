     <p>Taylor Swift is one of the most famous popstars of this era. She is known for
     her poetic songwriting skills. Currently, she has seven studio albums: Taylor
     Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014),
     Reputation (2017), Lover (2019).</p>

     <p>Growing up listening to Taylor Swift, I really enjoy her songwriting that really
      captures the feelings of youth. This project uses Python and SQL to analyze her
      lyrics and uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the interface.</p>
