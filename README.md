Using Python and SQL to analyze Taylor Swift Lyrics (Summer 2019)

Also uses JavaScript, CSS and HTML for the web interface

This project was for the Coursera course "Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python" with Dr Charles Severance.

First, I scraped data from the internet and stored information into SQL. (azlyricsscraper.py)

Then, cleaned the data for further processing. (parser.py)

Lastly, analyzed and represented data in JavaScript format. (freqency.py, histogramPhrase.py)
