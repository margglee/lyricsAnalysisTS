Using Python and SQL to analyze Taylor Swift Lyrics (Summer 2019)\n
Also uses JavaScript, CSS and HTML for the web interface\n

This project was for the Coursera course "Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python" with Dr Charles Severance.\n

First, I scraped data from the internet and stored information into SQL. (azlyricsscraper.py)\n
Then, cleaned the data for further processing. (parser.py)\n
Lastly, analyzed and represented data JavaScript format. (freqency.py)\n
